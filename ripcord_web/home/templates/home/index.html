      <h3>A place for students to share their intuition</h3>
      <p>
        Students often make some of the best teachers.
        Their knowledge of a subject is not only more recent, but their shared
        perspective makes it easier to connect with a peer and meet them where
        they are.
        <br><br>
        Because of this, it's no secret that many intuitive study resources
        come not from official materials, books, and documentation, but from
        peers and recent graduates.
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, these resources are often scattered across various
        corners of the internet and obscure Discord servers.
        <br><br>
        <i>That's where Ripcord comes in. <span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">(not really)</span></i>
